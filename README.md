Retexture Hypixel SkyBlock Items in a vanilla-like way.

## Installation Guide

- Prerequisites: [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)
- Download into your favourite launcher or into your mods folder directly.
- Install any texturepack that requires Catharsis to work.

## How to create a Catharsis Texture Pack

Check out our [wiki](https://catharsis.meowdd.ing) for information.

## What can be retextured?

Catharsis allows resourcepacks to retexture any item or Ore Vein in SkyBlock.
<br>For a full list, visit our [wiki](https://catharsis.meowdd.ing).
<br>To help with this, we add custom predicates:

### Item Predicates

- `catharsis:data_type` - Custom handled datatypes that are in the NBT data of items.
- `catharsis:item_model` - The item model ID of the item.
- `catharsis:skyblock_island` - The island id the player is currently in.
- `catharsis:skyblock_area` - The area the player is currently in.

### Armor Models

Texturepacks can hide player body/armor parts, add different conditions like sneaking, render fully 3d armor models and more!

### Block Replacement

Replace a specific block, island specific blocks, custom provided areas and more!
