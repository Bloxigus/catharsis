# Virtual Block State

A virtual block state is a modified [vanilla block state file](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Models#Block_states) placed at `<namespace>/catharsis/virtual_block_states/<id>.json`.

A virtual block state is used in combination with a block replacement to replace all properties of a block, and allowing changes based on the blocks state.

<Example>

Things that happen in this example
- Replaces the targeted block with `diamond_block`
- Replaces bedrock that appeared in the place for the targeted block with `gold_block`
- Changes the `place_sound` to `minecraft:block.chorus_flower.grow`
- Changes the blend mode to `translucent`
